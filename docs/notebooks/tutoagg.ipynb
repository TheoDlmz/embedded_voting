    "In general algorithm aggregation rules (Average, Median, Likelihood maximization), you need diversity among the different algorithms. However, in the real world, it is not rare to have a large group of very correlated algorithms, which are trained on the same datasets, or which have the same structure, and give very similar answers. This can biais the results.\n",
