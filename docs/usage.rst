To use Embedded Voting in a project::

    import embedded_voting as ev


To see how to use this library, take a look at the tutorials :

* `1. My first Profile <https://embedded-voting.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/profile.html>`_

This notebook cover the creation of a profile of voters with embeddings, and details the different
functions you can use to build and display this profile.

* `2. Run an election <https://embedded-voting.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/election.html>`_
* `3. The rules in more details <https://embedded-voting.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/moving.html>`_

In these notebooks, you will learn how to run a single-winner election on a
profile and what are the different scoring rules you can use.

* `4. Ordinal preferences <https://embedded-voting.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/ordinal.html>`_

This notebook shows how you can convert a cardinal voting profile into an ordinal voting profile
by combining ordinal voting rule like Plurality and Borda with our rules.

* `5. Manipulability analysis <https://embedded-voting.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/manipulation.html>`_

This notebook show how you can explore the question of the manipulability of
the different rules and their ordinal extensions.

* `6. Multi-winner elections <https://embedded-voting.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/multiwinner.html>`_

In this notebook, you will learn how to run a multi-winner election on a profile of voters.

* `7. Introduction to algorithms aggregation <https://embedded-voting.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/aggregation_intro.html>`_
* `8. Analysis of algorithms aggregation <https://embedded-voting.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/aggregation_2.html>`_

Finally, these notebooks show how profile with embedded voters can be used for the aggregation
of decision algorithms.
