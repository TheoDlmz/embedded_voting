class Aggregator:
    """
    A class for an election generator with memory.
    You can run an election by calling
    it with the matrix of scores.

    Parameters
    ----------
    rule: Rule
        The aggregation rule you want to use in your elections. Default is :class:`~embedded_voting.RuleFastNash`

    Attributes
    ----------
    embeddings: Embeddings
        The current embeddings of the voters

    ratings_history: np.ndarray
        The history of all ratings given by the voter. Is used to compute correlations between
        voters.

    rule: Rule
        The scoring rule used for the elections.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> aggregator = Aggregator()
    >>> results = aggregator([[7, 5, 9, 5, 1, 8], [7, 5, 9, 5, 2, 7], [6, 4, 2, 4, 4, 6], [3, 8, 1, 3, 7, 8]])
